- My name is Mitchell van Rijswijk, a Dutch, 24-year-old student currently in the third year of pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in software development at the HAN University of Applied Sciences. With a programming journey dating back to 2018, I have accumulated extensive knowledge from various angles, spanning many of the most common programming languages and concepts.
- Adept at grasping the overarching scope of software projects, I specialize in resolving architectural challenges and teamwork. My interests lie in adhering to clean code principles, leveraging design patterns, and I get great satisfaction from code optimization. Driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge since childhood, I have always remained enthusiastic about continuous learning. Over time, I have cultivated a renewed fascination with mathematics and its extensive application in deep learning.
